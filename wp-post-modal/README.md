##Frequently Asked Questions

####Where is the documentation?
[See Documentation](http://wp-post-modal.allureprojects.com/documentation)

####Will these Popups be blocked by an Ad Blocker
They will not because these aren't "popups" in the sense of an Ad. The way this works is by creating a modal window which is a just a section of your page that is hidden until a click or some other action makes it visible.

####Where does the content of the popup come from?
The content can come from any web page. If it is from a post or page (or any custom post type) from your site, it will
be the content that is in the WordPress editor (or from a custom template) . In other words, the popup will not show
your header, footer, nor sidebars. Just the primary content. If it is from another website, it will typically be the
core or main content on that page, but you define that.

You simply make a page or post with the content you want, as you always do.

####How is the popup triggered?
[See Documentation](http://wp-post-modal.allureprojects.com/documentation)

####Can I use anchor links?
Yes, you can add an anchor to the end of your URL (for internally linked pages) and the popup will scroll to the
position of the anchor.

####What if my External Page isn't loading
If your external page isn't working, then you can try using the [iFrame method](http://wp-post-modal.allureprojects.com/documentation). With the iFrame method the entire external page will load. You will not be able to specify a specific div to load.

There are two ways to use the iframe method:

1. Add the class `iframe` to your modal-link to selectively use the iframe method
1. Turn on the iframe method in the plugin settings to make all external links use the iframe method

####Can I change the look of trigger link?
Absolutely, any way you want. You can turn it into a button like this: `<a class="modal-link" href="http://my-site/privacy-policy/"><button type="button">Our Privacy Policy</button></a>` or make it an image.

####How do I change the look of the popup it self? What settings are available?
[See Documentation](http://wp-post-modal.allureprojects.com/documentation)

####Can I have multiple popups on one page?
Yes, you can have as many as you like.
